/**
 * A container used to display menus. It should be placed inside a {@link Menu}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Supported event: onOpen.<br/>
 * Note: to have better performance, onOpen is sent only if non-deferrable event
 * listener is registered (see {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.event.Deferrable}).
 * 
 * <p>
 * To load the content dynamically, you can listen to the onOpen event, and then
 * create menuitem when {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.event.OpenEvent#isOpen} is true.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Default {@link #getZclass}: z-menu-popup. (since 3.5.0)
